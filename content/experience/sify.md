### Hyderabad, India | September 2019 – September 2020

My first professional role at SiFY Technologies was where I learned that data engineering is much more than writing SQL queries—it's about building reliable systems that other people depend on. As an ETL Developer working with financial and operational data, I discovered the importance of precision, documentation, and thinking beyond just making code work.

**Learning Production ETL Development**

Starting with batch ETL pipelines using Spark, Hive, and SQL to process around 50GB of daily operational and financial data, I learned that production systems require a different mindset than academic projects. When regulatory reports depend on your pipeline running successfully every night, you quickly understand the importance of error handling, logging, and monitoring.

**Building Data Quality Foundations**

One of my most valuable learning experiences was developing validation queries in Python and SQL that could catch data inconsistencies before they propagated downstream. Early in my career, I learned that preventing bad data is much easier than fixing it after it's already caused problems in reports and dashboards.

**Modern Development Practices**

This role introduced me to CI/CD practices using Jenkins and Git, which completely changed how I approached development. Learning to write code that could be automatically tested, deployed, and rolled back gave me confidence to make changes without breaking production systems.

**Supporting Regulatory Requirements**

Working with financial data meant every transformation had to be auditable and defensible. I learned to write documentation not just for my future self, but for auditors and compliance teams who needed to understand exactly how data flowed through our systems.

**Growing Technical Confidence**

What started as contributing to existing pipeline designs gradually evolved into taking ownership of specific modules and participating in architectural discussions. The technical stack—Spark, Hive, and SQL—provided a solid foundation in distributed computing concepts that would prove invaluable in later roles.

**Setting Career Direction**

This first role taught me that I enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of data engineering: figuring out how to efficiently move and transform data while maintaining quality and reliability. The satisfaction of seeing monthly reports generate successfully because of systems I helped build confirmed that this was the right career path.

The experience taught me that being a good engineer isn't just about technical skills—it's about reliability, clear communication, and understanding how your work fits into larger business objectives.
