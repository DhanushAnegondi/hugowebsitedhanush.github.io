### (August 2023 - May 2024)
As a Teaching Assistant at Indiana University, I had the enriching opportunity to mentor and lead a group of 100 students.

I was actively involved in guiding students through practical coding exercises and data exploration projects using tools like PowerBI & Tableau. My role also involved facilitating weekly discussion sessions where I helped reinforce key concepts and addressed students' queries related to various data analysis topics, including temporal, geospatial, topical, and network data analysis.

This role not only allowed me to deepen my own understanding of these subjects but also helped me develop my skills in mentoring and leadership, preparing me to take on future educational challenges.
