### (January 2024 - May 2024)

I am deeply grateful to Professor Andreas Buekle and Katy Borner for the opportunity to delve into the HuBMAP and RUI projects.

HuBMAP, the Human BioMolecular Atlas Project, aims to develop a comprehensive atlas detailing every cell type in the human body using genomic, proteomic, and other biomarkers. The Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) Tables, which utilize the Uber Anatomy Ontology (UBERON), are pivotal in organizing this vast amount of data. BioPortal has proved invaluable as a repository for this biomedical ontology information, supported by NIH and accessible to the public.

I have Developed a dashboard for weekly/monthly research releases of the data using d3.js, observeable HQ and Javascript.
