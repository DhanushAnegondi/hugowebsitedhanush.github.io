# Bike Dataset Analysis

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of a comprehensive bike dataset, focusing on trends and patterns that influence bike usage and operational efficiencies. Utilizing advanced features of Tableau, I created a dynamic dashboard that not only visualizes historical usage data but also provides interactive features for deeper analysis.

The dashboard leverages Tableau’s powerful analytics capabilities, including calculated fields, parameters, and filter actions to offer insights into peak usage times, route preferences, and customer behavior. I employed Tableau's geographic mapping to visually represent bike traffic flow and usage density across different regions. This not only enhances the understanding of spatial distribution but also assists in strategic planning for bike station placements and maintenance schedules. The use of Tableau’s data blending and aggregation tools allowed me to integrate weather data, further enriching the analysis by correlating weather conditions with bike usage patterns.

This project highlights the potential of Tableau to transform raw data into actionable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making in urban mobility planning.
