# Uber Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Uber trip data sourced from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's website. The process began with downloading the dataset and performing thorough data analysis using Python to uncover key insights and trends. After preprocessing the data, it was uploaded to a cloud storage bucket and made publicly accessible to facilitate further analysis and collaboration.

For the ETL operations, I utilized Mage AI to efficiently transform and load the data into BigQuery. In BigQuery, I performed extensive SQL analytics to derive meaningful patterns and insights from the data. To visualize the analysis results, I used Looker Studio by Google, creating detailed and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate the findings. This project demonstrates the power of combining cloud technologies and advanced analytics to extract valuable insights from large datasets.
