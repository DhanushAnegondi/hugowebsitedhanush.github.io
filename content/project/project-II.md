# Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying sports images into various categories using advanced deep learning models. We employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, utilizing the Sports Classification dataset from Kaggle. The dataset was preprocessed with image augmentation and normalization to improve model generalization. We implemented three models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0, all pre-trained on ImageNet, which significantly enhanced their performance on our classification task.

Training and evaluating these models revealed that EfficientNetB0 provided the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, while ResNet50 and InceptionV3 also showed strong performance. The project successfully demonstrated the power of deep learning and transfer learning in tackling complex image classification challenges, showcasing the benefits of using pre-trained models for achieving high accuracy and efficient performance.
