# MovieLens Recommendation System

In this comprehensive project, a sophisticated movie recommendation system was developed using the extensive MovieLens dataset. By employing a blend of advanced machine learning models such as ALS for matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering, and XGBoost, the system robustly predicts user preferences. The project also integrates a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both collaborative and content-based filtering, enhancing the accuracy and personalization of recommendations.

The analytical process encompassed detailed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to optimize the models' performance. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were conducted to ensure the reliability of the models. The effectiveness of the models was rigorously evaluated using RMSE as the metric. Visual insights were generated using various visualization tools, which illustrated the distribution of user ratings and the performance of different models, showcasing the project's success in creating a dynamic and effective recommendation system.
